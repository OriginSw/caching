Sixeyed.Caching-Bardock
=======

A C# framework library for wrapping .NET cache access, including the MemoryCache, AppFabric Cache, Memcached and a disk cache.

## TO-DO's

This framework needs refactoring:
* Simplify abstractions and use extension methods
* Support dependency injection
* Improve unit tests (coverage, readability, code organizacion and reuse)
* Apply SOLID principles

This is a fork of [Sixeyed.Caching](Sixeyed.Caching-Bardock), so may be we need a new fresh start (new project, repo, and so on).
